[View live project](https://mcnic16.github.io/sistersresincraftnew/index.html)

This is the Website for Sister Resin Crafts. It is designed to be responsive and accessible on a range of devices, making it easy to navigate for potential customers with potential developments to be added in the future.
Currently all items on the site are linked to an Etsy shop. Items cannot be purchased through the website but this development will be added at a later date.
The Home page is also the page for the shop, with items that currently available for purchase. The about page is a bit about how the items are made and a bit about Sister Resin Craft and the third page is a customer review page. I had wanted to add a form to the page, but I did have some technical problems with it, and due to time issues aswell I have decide to add it at a later date.
